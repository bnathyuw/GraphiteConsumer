# Ascii Graphite Consumer

## About this project

We use Raspberry Pis as our stats monitors, and they have trouble running multiple tabs in Chrome.

I was talking to a colleague, and the idea came up to use a simple text browser rather than a full graphical browser like Chrome.

So I thought I would have a play with creating a Graphite consumer that just outputs Ascii art.

This is that project.
